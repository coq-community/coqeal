CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library
==========================================

This repository contains a subset of the work that was developed in
the context of the ForMath european project (2009-2013).
This archive is split in four parts:

- theory (package CoqEAL-theory), which contains formal developments
  in algebra.

- refinements, which contains optimized algorithms with a framework to
  ease change of representation during a proof.

- v0.1, a previous version of the framework, for archiving purpose.

- doc, tools for generating documentation out of local documentation.
